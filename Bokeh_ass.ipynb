    "Q1. How can you create a Bokeh plot using Python code?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    To create a Bokeh plot using Python code, you need to follow these general steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Import the necessary modules: Import the required modules from the Bokeh library. Typically, you will need to import bokeh.\n",
    "    plotting and other relevant sub-modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prepare the data: Create or load the data that you want to visualize in the plot. Ensure that the data is in a format suitable\n",
    "    for plotting, such as NumPy arrays, Pandas DataFrames, or Python lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a figure: Use the figure() function to create a new figure object that will serve as the canvas for your plot. This \n",
    "    function allows you to specify various parameters such as the plot width, height, title, axis labels, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add glyphs: Use the various glyph methods available in Bokeh to add visual elements to the plot. Glyphs represent the visual\n",
    "    markers or shapes that represent your data. For example, you can use circle(), line(), rect(), etc., to add different types \n",
    "    of markers or shapes to the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customize the plot: Use additional methods and properties to customize the appearance and behavior of your plot. You can modify\n",
    "    aspects such as line colors, fill colors, marker sizes, axis scales, grid lines, legends, tooltips, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add the plot to a document: Create a document to hold your plot by using the bokeh.plotting module's output_file() or\n",
    "    output_notebook() functions. These functions specify whether the plot should be saved to an HTML file or displayed directly\n",
    "    in a Jupyter notebook, respectively.\n",

    "    be triggered by user interactions (e.g., button clicks, dropdown selections) or external data sources (e.g., periodic \n",
    "     updates from a database). Inside the callback functions, update the properties or data of the plot accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add callbacks to the plot: Connect the callbacks to specific events or interactions in the plot using the available tools and \n",
    "    widgets in Bokeh. This is typically done by setting the on_event or on_change attribute of a tool or widget to the \n",
